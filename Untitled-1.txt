Meeting letter vs Meeting Email
Should you send your meeting request via email or letter?
Well, it all depends on who is going to receive your request. 
If it is a government official, then most probably you will need a formal letter. 
If it is a client, then an email will do just fine.

Meeting checklist, before you send your email
It is a good idea to check the availability of the person by phone;
for example, by calling their secretory or the reception. 
The last thing you want is for emails to go back and forth trying to schedule a meeting. 
Aim for success from the first try. Of course this is optional.

Make sure that you yourself are available.
Many people forget that have they already have other commitments at the proposed time of the meeting.

Check the correct job title, position, and name of the person. Do your research properly.

Depending on the situation, 
you may need to consider incentives to increase the chances of fixing the appointment. 
Business lunch is a common tactic to lure a client to accept the meeting.
